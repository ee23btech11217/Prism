## Assembly Architecture

The Prism console uses a custom 16-bit instruction set architecture (ISA) called Nyx for its core processing:

- **Instruction Format**: 18-bit wide instructions
- **Register File**: 15 general-purpose registers per thread
- **Addressing Modes**: Register-direct and immediate
- **Key Instructions**:
  - Arithmetic: `add`, `sub`, `mul`
  - Logical: `and`, `or`, `not`
  - Memory: `ldb`, `str`
  - Flow Control: `jmp`, `beq`, `ble`
  - Special: `bsh` (barrel shift), `hlt` (halt)
- **Extended Instructions**:
  - Convenience ops: `mov`, `cmp`, `test`, `lds`, `ldc`, `inc`

## Project Structure

- **Hardware Design**: PCB and schematic files for Zynq FPGA-based board
- **FPGA Development**: Verilog sources for processor core and GPU
- **Drivers**: C++ access layers for hardware components
- **Graphics Library**: GL-compatible rendering system
- **Emulation**: OpenGL-based desktop emulator

## Development Timeline

The project follows a phased development approach:
1. **Phase 1**: Architecture design and specifications freeze
2. **Phase 2**: Low-spec implementation (200 √ó 120 @ 60fps)
3. **Phase 3**: Mid-spec implementation (400 √ó 240 @ 60fps)
4. **Phase 4**: PCB design/fabrication and hardware assembly
5. **Phase 5**: Game development and testing


### Emulation
The emulator provides a desktop environment for testing games and applications before deploying to the hardware device.
